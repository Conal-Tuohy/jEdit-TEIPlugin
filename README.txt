jEdit TEI plugin

The plugin source is discussed in detail in the 'Writing Plugins' part
of the jEdit user's guide.

The source code has been updated to conform the the Plugin API for version 5.0
of jEdit. 

If you are writing your own plugin and starting with this as a starting point,
we recommend keeping the build.xml, dockables.xml, actions.xml, servies.xml, PluginName.props, 
users-guide.xml, and description.html in the root directory of your plugin, 
placing other resources in packages/subfolders.
